abstract: "Cardinality estimation (CardEst) plays a significant role in
  generating high-quality query plans for a query optimizer in DBMS. In the last
  decade, an increasing number of advanced CardEst methods (especially ML-based)
  have been proposed with outstanding estimation accuracy and inference latency.
  However, there exists no study that systematically evaluates the quality of
  these methods and answer the fundamental problem: to what extent can these
  methods improve the performance of query optimizer in real-world settings,
  which is the ultimate goal of a CardEst method. In this paper, we
  comprehensively and systematically compare the effectiveness of CardEst
  methods in a real DBMS. We establish a new benchmark for CardEst, which
  contains a new complex real-world dataset STATS and a diverse query workload
  STATS-CEB. We integrate multiple most representative CardEst methods into an
  open-source database system PostgreSQL, and comprehensively evaluate their
  true effectiveness in improving query plan quality, and other important
  aspects affecting their applicability, ranging from inference latency, model
  size, and training time, to update efficiency and accuracy. We obtain a number
  of key findings for the CardEst methods, under different data and query
  settings. Furthermore, we find that the widely used estimation accuracy
  metric(Q-Error) cannot distinguish the importance of different sub-plan
  queries during query optimization and thus cannot truly reflect the query plan
  quality generated by CardEst methods. Therefore, we propose a new metric
  P-Error to evaluate the performance of CardEst methods, which overcomes the
  limitation of Q-Error and is able to reflect the overall end-to-end
  performance of CardEst methods."
